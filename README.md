Introducing the "Pakistan Telecommunication Authorization" Replica:

Our system replicates the "Pakistan Telecommunication Authorization" framework, connecting companies like Quantum-Connect, Future-Connect, Nova Link, Aero Cell, InfiniTel, and others. We enable seamless device communication via city towers, connecting them with their parent companies and the central hub, TeleNet-X. Robust security is ensured with SSH encryption in company server departments.
